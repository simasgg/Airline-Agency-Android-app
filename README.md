# Airline-Agency-Android-app

Android app made with Java programming language. It's an airline agency app which allows client to select travel destination, choose type of trip (one-way, round trip),
departure or return date (DatePickerDialog), type of ticket (First class, Business, Economy) each with different pricing, add passenger (which opens new Activity) and
enter passenger info such as his name/surname/gender/birth date and search for ticket and it's price based on his age. Several tickets can be bought. Selecting 'Buy tickets' will
open new activity with card info to enter and 'pay' will take back to home page (first activity). Overall, this app has 3 Activities. The main goal of this app was to work with UI
design, therefore this app has no meaningful functionalities and error handling.
